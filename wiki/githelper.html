            <h2>Pronunciation</h2>
            <p>
                Before using Gelper, you should know how to pronounce it, right? Here's the correct
                pronunciation versus the incorrect pronunciation:
                <p>
                <li><b>Correct: </b><em>Gell-per</em></li>
                <li><b>Incorrect: </b><em>Jell-qer</em></li>
                <li><b>Incorrect: </b><em>Jell-per</em></li>
                <p>
                    Yes! Jelper and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/jelqing">Jelqer</a>
                     are both incorrect pronunciations!
                     <p>
                        <b>P.S. Don't click the hyperlink on 'Jelqer'</b>

            <h2>Quick Start</h2>
            <p>
                In the new and improved, latest Gelper2 was added the Quick Start (QS) feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                The QS feature made other features such as configuration redundant, ergo those have
                been deprecated. Please download '1.1.0 stable' if you wish to use the Legacy Gelper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The QS feature enables you to quickly add and commit files. You need to
                use the QS mode via the '--q' flag. Here's how:
<code><pre>
gelper2 --q 'filename.extension' :: "message to commit to github repo"
</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                The syntax looks amazing. Version 2.0.1 is expected to replace the double-colon
                to something like '|>' or '--'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, the 'filename.extension' should be the path to your file. Here's how
                it would look if you were adding 'file.c' in 'src/files/c/'.
            </p>
<code><pre>
gelper2 --q 'src/files/c/file.c' :: "Add C file -- file.c"
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Other than this, you can use '!push' at the end to automatically push all
                staged commits. Here's how that would look:
            </p>
<code><pre>
gelper2 --q 'src/files/c/file.c' :: "Add C file -- file.c" !push
</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cloning</h2>
            <p>
                Gelper, quite like Git, can easily (now) in v2.1.3 do most of the things Git does.
                Out of those, the most prominent are cloning, committing, and pushing!
            </p>
            <p>
                Start Gelper with '--c' to clone. It displays a prompt. In it, enter your Github
                username, and the repository name (not link!!).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use '--dc' to directly clone. This one does not display the prompt.
                Instead, you can use it like:
<code><pre>
gelper2 --dc mickoissicko/githelper
</pre></code>
                <p>
                    And that will clone the 'githelper' repository.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use '--dc-ng' to truncate '.git' from the repository link.
                This will clone only the repository without the '.git' extension in the end.
            </p>
<code><pre>
gelper2 --dc-ng mickoissicko/githelper
</pre></code>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Archlinux User Repository</h2>
            <p>
                Gelper (natively) supports the AUR. And will support other repositories like the AUR
                soon! To utilise this feature, you can run Gelper with '--aur'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, just using the '--aur' flag will display a prompt 'Software:' and you
                would have to specify the software name, like 'sharexin.'
            </p>
            <p>
                It operates in the '/home/USER/aur.gelper_tmp/' directory, deleted upon exit
                unless you append '-nc', like '--aur-nc,' which doesn't delete upon exit, meaning
                you can rebuild later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than that, you can use the '--daur' flag. Which <b>directly</b> builds
                software from the AUR. Remember: you need a working 'makepkg.'
            </p>
<code><pre>
gelper2 --daur sharexin
</pre></code>
            <p>
                This copies 'sharexin' (a software in the AUR,) builds it, then deletes the
                temporary directory upon exit.
            </p>
<code><pre>
gelper2 --daur-nc sharexin
</pre></code>
            <p>
                This copes 'sharexin', builds it, but leaves the build files and the directory, meaning
                if you run the above command again, it will check for the software, and ask you
                if you want to rebuild it.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Flags</h2>
            <p>
                Gelper uses command-line arguments (commonly called 'flags'), to determine how you want
                to execute it.
            </p>
            <b>Advantages:</b>
            <p>
                <li>Easier</li>
                <li>Minimal setup</li>
                <li>Minimal configuration</li>
                <li>No need for extra files like '.githelper' or 'cfg/pref.yml'</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two flags at the moment: '--d' and '--k'. You can't really tell what they do
                but let me explain:
                <h3>'--d' flag</h3>
                <p>
                    The '--d' flag stands for 'detached'. It runs Gelper in a new session, meaning:
                    <li>Direct launch</li>
                    <li>No configuration</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When running Gelper, 'addfiles' and 'commit' will be created if they do not exist.
                    You will be prompted for their creation. In the end, both of the files will be
                    removed. Use '--k', or 'keepfile' to keep those files; to not remove them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After making the files and including commit info etc. you will be prompted if
                    you want to push these changes after the program processes the files, adds
                    to git, and commits. You can select either 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>'--k' flag</h3>
                <p>
                    '--k' stands for 'keep files'. You can add it after '--d' so the program
                    doesn't auto-delete 'addfiles' and 'commit' files after adding/committing. 
                </p>

            <h2>Setting an alias</h2>
            <p>
                Configuration is very, very easy. Gelper utilises the human-friendly data-serialisation
                YAML format!
            </p>
            <p>
                To start off, make an alias for Gelper. Here's how:
            </p>
            <p>
                On Windows, edit the Path system environment variable, and add the Gelper executable path,
                without the executable. Now you can run Gelper with 'gelper' or whatever the name of the
                executable is.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Linux, open your DOT Shell file. I use the Fish shell, so for me it would be:
                '~/.config/fish/config.fish'. Anyways, add this line in the configuration file:
            </p>
<code><pre>
alias gelper="/path/to/gelper/executable/file"
</pre></code>
            <p>
                That path has to be absolute. Why absolute? To save you pain. Here's why:
<code><pre>
alias gelper="../../path/to/gelper/executable/file"
</pre></code>
<p>
    But if you do not want to do that, you can just place the executable in the location of your
    DOT Files, and easily do:
</p>
<code><pre>
alias gelper="gelper"
</pre></code>
<p>
    And remember, it has to be the executable's full name, extensions matter. Let's say it is named
    'gelper.bin', then it would be 'gelper.bin'. It is also case-sensitive.
</p>
<p>
    Anyways, replace the 'path/to/gelper/executable/file' with the path to the executable. You can place
    yours in '~/Documents/executables/gelper', and set that as the path. 
    <p>To avoid conflicts, remove
    the tilde, and append (instead) '/home/USERNAME', where the USERNAME <b>(case-sensitive)</b>, is
    the username of your Linux PC.</p>
</p>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="cool">Deprecation notice</h2>
            <p class="cool"><b><em>Please note: the below guide is deprecated
                and for version 1.1.0-stable!
            </em></b></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Remember</b>: <em>Gelper must be run inside a Github repository!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting off, navigate to the folder where the executable is stored, and run this
                command:
<code><pre>
gelper -cfg
</pre></code>
                <p>
                    That command will generated a YAML configuration file with the name 'pref.yml'.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, open 'pref.yml' and the contents of it should look like this:
<code><pre>
# By default, some flags are true/false
MakeFiles: True
Cleanup: True
AutoPush: Off
# The AutoPush flag pushes the changes automatically in the end
#
# Change the value of MakeFiles to false if: 
# You do not want the program to automatically make 'commit' and 'addfiles' files
# Change it to true if you do want that behaviour
#
# The cleanup flag just deletes those files upon exit
</pre></code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Read the comments. They should give you an idea of how to use it.
                Remember, it is case-sensitive, so 'True' has to be exactly 'True' or 'False', and
                not 'true' or 'false'. Similarly, you can't see 'Off' to 'True'. It has to be 'On'.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MakeFiles flag automatically generates the 'commit' and 'addfiles' files, whereas
                if it were 'False', then it would not generate those files, and instead, you'd be
                prompted for their creation. You can choose no and manually create them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Cleanup flag, as said in the comments, deletes those files upon exit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The AutoPush flag automatically pushes your changes to Github when you are done
                editing and press 'Y' in the prompt.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is Off by default to avoid any rash decisions. If 'Off', then Gelper prompts you
                if you want to push changes or no. You can select 'n' as no, and push those changes
                later after reviewing them (if you really want to).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Commit & Addfiles</h2>
            <p>
                When you start Gelper, and if the MakeFiles flag is 'True' it will make two files:
                <b><em>commit</em></b> and <b><em>addfiles</em></b>.
                <p>
                    If the flag is 'False', then you will be prompted for their creation. If you select
                    no, then you can manually create them later.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <em><b>commit</b></em> file, you can specify the message for each file
                you will be committing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <em><b>addfiles</b></em> file, you can specify which files you want to stage
                for commit.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>An example</h2>
            <p>
                Let's say you run Gelper in the Github repository you wish to edit.
                Make sure to run it in the root folder to avoid relative paths or having to add paths
                like '../files/a_file.ext'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, let's say you want to add these files to the Github repository:
                <p>
                    <li>MyFile.txt</li>
                    <li>HisFile.txt</li>
                    <li>OurFile.communism</li>
                    <li>TheirFile.saddness</li>

                Here's how you would do that. Given that you've run Gelper, and the 'commit'
                and 'addfiles' files have been created, you can start by editing
                'addfiles' first:
            </p>
<code><pre>
MyFile.txt
HisFile.txt
OurFile.communism
TheirFile.saddness
</pre></code>
            <p>
                Now, let's edit the 'commit' file:
            </p>
<code><pre>
Added my file
Added his file
Added our file
Added their file
</pre></code>
            <p>
                Gelper avoids the unnessescary jargon. Remember, line numbers matter. Here's what 
                I mean:
                <p>
                    addfiles: On Line 1, we added 'MyFile.txt'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    commit: On Line 1, we added the message for 'MyFile.txt'. 
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                So yes, no need to specify filename in 'commit'. Makes workflow fast!
