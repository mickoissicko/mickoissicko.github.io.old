      <div class="title">What is a Pingspoofer?</div>
      <div class="information-text">
         <p>Pingspoofing is used in online gaming where a user intentionally introduces artificial delay to their network interface, causing their in-game ping to appear higher than it actually is. The term "ping" refers to the time it takes for data packets to travel from the user's device to the game server and back again.</p>
         <p>By manipulating their ping, a Pingspoofer can create the illusion of teleporting or lagging on the screens of other players in the game.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="information-text">
         <p>A network interface serves as the bridge between a computer or device and a network. It is the network adapter you use to connect to your router.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="information-text">
         <p>The primary motive behind Pingspoofing is gaining a competitive advantage in online multiplayer games, such as Minecraft, CS:GO, and Valorant. Pingspoofers' movements may look unpredictable as they often drop a few packets, causing them to appear as if they are teleporting.</p>
         <p>In games like Minecraft, Pingspoofing can delay hit registration and knockback, making it difficult for opponents to hit them effectively. However, using such techniques is considered unethical and against the terms of service in most gaming communities.</p>
