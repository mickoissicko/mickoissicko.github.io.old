      <div class="question">What is Pingspoofing?</div>
      <div class="answer">
         <p>Pingspoofing is used in online gaming where a user intentionally introduces artificial delay to their network interface, causing their in-game ping to appear higher than it actually is. The term "ping" refers to the time it takes for data packets to travel from the user's device to the game server and back again.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">How does Pingspoofing help you gain an advantage in games?</div>
      <div class="answer">
         <p>By manipulating their ping, a Pingspoofing user can create the illusion of teleporting or lagging on the screens of other players in the game. This can make their movements seem unpredictable and hard to target or hit. In games like Minecraft, Pingspoofing can delay hit registration and knockback, making it difficult for opponents to hit them effectively. However, using such techniques is considered unethical and against the terms of service in most gaming communities.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">What is a network interface?</div>
      <div class="answer">
         <p>A network interface serves as the bridge between a computer or device and a network. It is the network adapter you use to connect to your router.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">Why even Pingspoof?</div>
      <div class="answer">
         <p>The primary motive behind Pingspoofing is gaining a competitive advantage in online multiplayer games, such as Minecraft, CS:GO, and Valorant. Pingspoofers' seemingly unpredictable movements due to the artificial delay can make it difficult for opponents to land shots accurately, giving them an unfair edge in the game. However, it's essential to promote fair play and respect for others in gaming communities. Pingspoofing is considered cheating and is strongly discouraged. Players are encouraged to enjoy the game without resorting to unethical practices.</p>
