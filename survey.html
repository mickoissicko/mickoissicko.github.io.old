        <b>
            DEAR USER,
        </b>
        if you are reading this, then you must have gotten invited to fill the
        <em>
            <b>
                Person Survey!
            </b>
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before proceeding, make sure to keep these in mind:
        <ul>
            <li>Be honest; what you really think matters.</li>
            <li>Assume the person is someone you know, like me.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        How to answer:
        <ul>
            <li>The survey is about what you don't want in a person.</li>
            <li>The survey is about what you think could be a mental illness.</li>
            <li>The survey is about what you think is weird in a person.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now with that out of the way, you should be ready to fill the survey!
        However, you may have your doubts -- heck, even I would have been skeptical.
        To reassure you, there is an FAQ, and some other information.
    </p>
    <p>
        FAQ:
        <ul>
            <li><qe>Is it anonymous?</qe> <g>Yes.</g></li>
            <li><qe>Why?</qe> <g>It's a survey.</g></li>
            <li><qe>Will these results be used for something else?</qe> <r>No.</r></li>
            <li><qe>Will this data be uploaded elsewhere on the internet?</qe> <r>No.</r></li>
            <li><qe>Will this data be used for ML?</qe> <r>No.</r></li>
            <li><qe>Do I have to answer these questions?</qe> <g>Yes.</g></li>
            <li><qe>Why should I waste my time on this?</qe> <g>It will be used for a good cause.</g></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please take ~20-30 minutes out of your time, and fill out the survey. It will help a lot! :D.
    </p>
    <p>
        And, by the way, 'X' is the person. Remember to assume its a friend or someone you know (like me).
        If you do assume me, then its even better. However, don't strictly base it off of my personality. The survey is <b><em>unrelated</em></b>, but I'd encourage you to assume its me.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may fill out the survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zFVsjLh_loM2IECLNxkvB74He1Xd-rzZYCMfT3kM1to/viewform?edit_requested=true">right here!</a>
